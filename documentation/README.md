## Banterly - enjoy friendly banter

### What it is

This is an application made for practice purposes as an assignment within an educational program. I decided to make a Twitter clone because I thought it would be fun to try it out and hone my full stack skills. Please se instructions below on how to set up the program and get started. Enjoy!

### How to get started

Clone repo
npm install
npm run dev

### Important files

Connection to db: server/db/connectMongoDB

JWT: lib/utils/generateToken.js

### Contents of application

In this application users can create an account where they can create posts with text and have the option to add an image if they want to. Users can also comment on other posts, follow/unfollow other users and see the posts they have liked on their profile page. Instead of an admin-feature I have added a comments-CRUD feature to my application, where the users can create, edit and delete comments they have made, and of course also read comments. You can read more about my process in the _documentation_ -> _Loggbok_.
